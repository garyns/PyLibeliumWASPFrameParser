# PyLibeliumWASPFrameParser

This is a place holder for a Python Library to parse Libelium WASP Frame Formats.

I just need to finish it off, clean up the comments and test and get it committed.

At this stage, this repository will host a community edition of the parser and supporting tools.

Features currently supported features are:

* Prase ASCII frames
* Parse Binary frames
* Parse Tiny Binary frames
* Decrypt ASCII and Binary encrypted frames
* Sensor Registry to provide context and consistancy between ASCII and Binary parsed sensor data.
* TCP proxy server for testing and debugging integrations.
* Extensive testing framework and WASPMote IDE test frame generating code.
* Future port to NodeJS.
